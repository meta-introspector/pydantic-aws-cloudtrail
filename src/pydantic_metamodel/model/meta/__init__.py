"""
Lets consider this as a quasi meta self describing mathematical group structure
it should be able to enumerate and count its own self form and reform itself.
idea: we want to be able to add quasi model elements to each other like integers.
imagine we can treat an entire model as a number or string, we can then also decompose it.
each event in the system can be seen as a pattern for every other event.
so my idea is we can flatten events into a set of features.
some features are unique, like identifiers, we can think of these as large unique primes.
then we can view timestamps and locations as values that are close to each other.
so some types are scalar, embeded, compact. we can model the manifold of spacetime this way.
each value assigned is an auditable event in the system.
so the event gets an audit process that witnesses it.
this then proves compliance. we can think of the state of compliance as the
outstanding events to be processed. the system produces new events so it then creates a burden on itself.
eventually we can reuse existing parts so that we can prove based on what has been done before
thus creating a zero added knowledge proof on top of what has been revealed already.
