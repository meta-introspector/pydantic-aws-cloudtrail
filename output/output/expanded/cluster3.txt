To create a comprehensive representation of the JSON Schema model using an object-oriented approach, we can define classes for each component and establish relationships between them based on the edges provided. Here's a Python implementation:

```python
from typing import List, Dict

class Properties:
    def __init__(self, root=None):
        self.root = root

class Root:
    pass  # Define the Root class as needed

class Flag(Properties):
    pass  # Flag inherits from Properties and can be customized

class Hierarchical(Properties):
    pass  # Hierarchical inherits from Properties and can be customized

class ListModel(Properties):
    pass  # ListModel inherits from Properties and can be customized

class OutputUnit(Properties):
    pass  # OutputUnit inherits from Properties and can be customized

class OutputUnitArray(Properties):
    pass  # OutputUnitArray inherits from Properties and can be customized

class FieldDefs:
    def __init__(self, flag=None, hierarchical=None, list_model=None, output_unit=None, output_unit_array=None):
        self.flag = flag
        self.hierarchical = hierarchical
        self.list_model = list_model
        self.output_unit = output_unit
        self.output_unit_array = output_unit_array

# Create instances based on the schema
root_instance = Root()
properties_instance = Properties(root=root_instance)
flag_instance = Flag(properties=properties_instance)
hierarchical_instance = Hierarchical(properties=properties_instance)
list_model_instance = ListModel(properties=properties_instance)
output_unit_instance = OutputUnit(properties=properties_instance)
output_unit_array_instance = OutputUnitArray(properties=properties_instance)

field_defs_instance = FieldDefs(
    flag=flag_instance,
    hierarchical=hierarchical_instance,
    list_model=list_model_instance,
    output_unit=output_unit_instance,
    output_unit_array=output_unit_array_instance
)

# Example of accessing relationships
print(field_defs_instance.flag.properties.root)  # Accessing the root from Flag instance
```

### Explanation:
1. **Properties Class**: A base class for all schema components, which can hold a `root` property.
2. **Root Class**: This would be further customized based on specific requirements.
3. **Flag, Hierarchical, ListModel, OutputUnit, OutputUnitArray Classes**: These classes inherit from `Properties` and are placeholders for any additional properties or methods that might be required.
4. **FieldDefs Class**: This class represents the main schema component that has relationships with other components as defined by the edges.

### Relationships:
- **Edges** (`[('FieldDefs', 'Flag'), ('FieldDefs', 'Hierarchical'), ('FieldDefs', 'ListModel'), ('FieldDefs', 'OutputUnit'), ('FieldDefs', 'OutputUnitArray'), ('Flag', 'Properties'), ('Hierarchical', 'Properties1')]`):
  - `field_defs_instance` has relationships with `flag_instance`, `hierarchical_instance`, `list_model_instance`, `output_unit_instance`, and `output_unit_array_instance`.
  - `flag_instance` has a relationship with `properties_instance`.
  - `hierarchical_instance` has a relationship with another instance of `Properties` (not shown in the code but would be similar to `flag_instance`).

### Usage:
- The example demonstrates how to create instances and access relationships between them.
- Additional properties or methods can be added to the classes as needed.

This structure allows for easy expansion and customization of each component based on specific requirements.
